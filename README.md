# XUND Web App Integration Guide

XUND Web App is a pre-made implementation of **[XUND APIs](https://xund-api-documentation.scrollhelp.site/xund-api-documentation/latest/general-information)** and it is ready for authorized clients to easily embed Symptom/Illness/Health Check into their website. The following guide is a detailed instruction of embedding the XUND Web App and also provides examples for quick and easy implementation.

## Prerequisites

1. You need to have access to [Client Hub](https://clienthub.xund.solutions/)
2. You can embed Web App on the page **only** with the exact origin defined in the [API Key](https://clienthub.xund.solutions/key/). [`üì∑`](readme-assets/clienthub-apikey-origin.png)
3. You need to have at least the following scopes set in the [API Key](https://clienthub.xund.solutions/key/) section of [Client Hub](https://clienthub.xund.solutions/). [`üì∑`](readme-assets/clienthub-apikey-scopes.png) 
* `Web App`, 
* at least `Illness Checks`, `Symptom Checks` or `Health Checks`
4. Optionally you can customize your embedded app's look and feel and its other properties [here](https://clienthub.xund.solutions/webApp/). [`üì∑`](readme-assets/clienthub-webapp-customize.png)

## Keys and IDs

| Name | Property Name | Description | Where to find? |
| - | ---- | - | - |
| Client ID | `client-id` | It's the unique identifier <br />of your organisation | Go to Client Hub and select <br />_API key_ from the left navigation <br />Scroll down for _Client ID_ [`üì∑`](readme-assets/clienthub-webapp-getcode.png) |
| Web App Code | `webapp-code` | Any number of Web Apps <br />can be defined. Every app <br />has its own settings (e.g. <br />Custom colors) | Go to Client Hub and select <br />_WebApp_ from the left navigation <br />Scroll down for _Code_ [`üì∑`](readme-assets/clienthub-apikey-getkey.png) |
| Auth Code | `auth-code` | In order to authenticatate <br />the Check session it's <br />necessary to have a valid Auth Code | If you have Frontent Authentication <br />enabled on Client Hub you'll get <br />one behind the scenes. Otherwise <br />you can get it during the Backend <br />Authentication |

## _Quick_: Try out

This kind of integration doesn't require a deep understanding of our **[APIs](https://xund-api-documentation.scrollhelp.site/xund-api-documentation/latest/general-information)** and you can quickly provide a full-featured Illness Check / Symptom Check to your users. 

> Make sure that _Frontend_ is selected as the _Authentication Method_ in the [API Key](https://clienthub.xund.solutions/key/) section of Client Hub. [`üì∑`](readme-assets/clienthub-apikey-frontend.png)

We recommend however to keep this option disabled and have the authentication implemented on your own server [as described here](https://github.com/XUND-Solutions-GmbH/backend-auth-flow-demo/) to ensure the maximum security of the Checks. 

Please insert the following snippet into the body of your HTML page where you want to have XUND Web App placed:
```html
<div id="your-container" style="width: 100vw; height: 100vh;">
  <script 
    src="https://webapp.xund.solutions/embed.js" 
    client-id="***" 
  />
</div>
```

## _Recommended_: Secure embedding

We encourage our partners to use our [Backend Authentication Method](https://github.com/XUND-Solutions-GmbH/backend-auth-flow-demo/) and provide the resulting authCode to the embbedding snippet: 

```html
<script 
  src="https://public.xund.solutions/embed.js" 
  client-id="***" 
  auth-code="***" 
/>
```
