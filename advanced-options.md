### Add profile data

If you want to launch the app with pre-defined profile data add these extra properties to the script tag: 

```html
<script ... gender="female" birth='2000-12-31" />
```

### Start with
If this is set, the welcome page is not visible on check restart. Possible values: ILLNESS_CHECK, SYMPTOM_CHECK

```html
<script ... direct-check="ILLNESS_CHECK" />
```

### Start symptom check with a symptom ID
If you want to start the Symptom check with a specific symptom, add this property:
```html
<script ... direct-check-main-symptom-id="YOUR-SYMPTOM-ID" />
```
#### Important notes
- This will automatically set the property `direct-check="SYMPTOM_CHECK"`, so you don't have to set it.
- The symptom ID must be a valid UUID format.

### Add onboarding page
If you want to add the onborading page before the Symptom or Illness checks start, add this property:
```html
<script ... onboarding="true" />
```

### Setup a webhook passing your custom ID after each check

#### Step 1: Client Hub

First, please turn on _Enable callback URL_ option on the Client Hub [API Key](https://clienthub.xund.solutions/key) section and point it to an existing endpoint on your server.

#### Step 2: Backend

When requesting the authorization code from the `/authorize` endpoint, include the `scope=state` parameter along with the `clientId`, `secretHash`, and `state`.

#### Step3: Frontend

Then extend the script's properties with `state`:

```html
<script ... state="YOUR-CUSTOM-ID" />
```

#### Step 4: Webhook callback

On your defined endpoint you'll receive a message like this: 

```json
{"checkId":"***", "state":"YOUR-CUSTOM-ID"}
```
